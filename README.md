# morphy
morphy is a code generation tool that can create copyWith, equals, toString, contructors and json to & from.
It's a bit like freezed or built_value but inheritance is allowed and polymorphism supported with copyWith and json.
There may be some edge cases so try it out and let me know how you get on.

### Reasoning:
We need a way to simplify our Dart classes, keep things cleaner and provide more functionality.

### Why Not Freezed or Built Value?
Well the main reason; I actually wrote this before Freezed was released.
Freezed is really good, established and well used.  
However if you want to use both inheritance and composition in your data classes use Morphy. 

### Solution: use morphy

## Simple Example
To create a new class.
1. add the package morphy_annotation to the dependencies and the package morphy and build_runner to the dev dependencies
```
    dart pub add morphy_annotation
    dart pub add --dev morphy
    dart pub add --dev build_runner
```
2. copy and paste the following code into a new dart file:
   ```
    import 'package:morphy_annotation/morphy_annotation.dart';
    part 'Pet.morphy.dart';
    
    @morphy
    abstract class $Pet {
      String get type;
    }
    ```

3. run the build_runner
```
    dart run build_runner build
```

and that's it!  You can then create your objects!

```
   var cat = Pet(type: "cat");
```

`$Pet` is the class definition name. The generated class, the one you use to create objects, will drop the dollar, ie `Pet`.

### Rules

As in the simplest example above, `morphy` class definitions must
1. start with a dollar (the generated class removes the dollar)
2. be made abstract (the generated class is not made abstract, details below on how to make classes abstract)
3. have the @morphy annotation added directly to the class name
4. have the part file added to the top of the file, ie `part 'Pet.morphy.dart';`
5. import the morphy_annotation package, ie `import 'package:morphy_annotation/morphy_annotation.dart';`
6. and all properties must be defined as getters, ie `String get type;`

## Basic features (comes with every class)

### Equality (and hashCode)

Morphy supports deep equality out of the box.

```
var cat1 = Pet(type: "cat");
var cat2 = Pet(type: "cat");

expect(cat1 == cat2, true);
```

### A constructor is created for each class

All fields are required, non nullable and final by default

```
var cat1 = Pet(type: "cat");
```

### CopyWith

A simple copy with implementation comes with every class.  
We pass a function to the copyWith_Pet method that returns a new value to set the property.
You can pass any value you like, including null if the property is nullable.

```
    var flossy = Pet(name: "Flossy", age: 5);
    var plossy = flossy.copyWith_Pet(name: () => "Plossy");

    expect(flossy.age, plossy.age);
```

### ToString

A default toString implementation is also included.

```
    var flossy = Pet(name: "Flossy", age: 5);

    expect(flossy.toString(), "(Pet-name:Flossy|age:5)");
```

### Inheritance

You can inherit one morphy class from another - use the implements keyword and the class definition name (the one with the dollar).
All properties will be inherited by default.

    @morphy
    abstract class $Cat implements $Pet {
      int get whiskerLength;
    }
    
    var bagpussCat = Cat(whiskerLength: 13.75, name: "Bagpuss", age: 4);
    
    expect(bagpussCat.whiskerLength, 13.75);

### CopyWith Polymorphic

Unlike other copy with implementations, morphy works on subclasses within the same file.
For example if you have a list of Person objects of which some are subtypes (Managers and Employees)
then the copyWith still works whilst preserving the underlying type.

    var pets = [
      Cat(whiskerLength: 13.75, name: "Bagpuss", age: 4),
      Dog(woofSound: "rowf", name: "Colin", age: 4),
    ];
    
    var petsOlder = pets //
        .map((e) => e.copyWith_Pet(age: () => e.age + 1))
        .toList();
    
    expect(petsOlder[0].age, 5);
    expect(petsOlder[1].age, 5);
 
Importantly the type remains the same, it is not converted to a Pet class.

    expect(petsOlder[0].runtimeType, Cat);
    expect(petsOlder[1].runtimeType, Dog);

### Enums are allowed

    @morphy
    abstract class $Fish implements $Pet {
      eFishColour get fishColour;
    }

    var goldie = Fish(fishColour: eFishColour.gold, name: "Goldie", age: 2);
    expect(goldie.fishColour, eFishColour.gold);

### Generics are allowed

Specify the class definition if you want to constrain your generic type (use the dollar) 

    @morphy
    abstract class $PetOwner<TPet extends $Pet> {
      String get ownerName;
      TPet get pet;
    }

    var cathy = PetOwner<Cat>(ownerName: "Cathy", pet: bagpussCat);
    var dougie = PetOwner<Dog>(ownerName: "Dougie", pet: colin);
    
    expect(cathy.pet.whiskerLength, 13.75);
    expect(dougie.pet.woofSound, "rowf");

### ChangeTo

Sometimes you might want to turn a super class into a subclass (Pet into a Cat)

    var flossy = Pet(name: "Flossy", age: 5);

    var bagpussCat = flossy.changeTo_Cat(whiskerLength: 13.75);

    expect(bagpussCat.whiskerLength, 13.75);
    expect(bagpussCat.runtimeType, Cat);

(subclass to super and sibling to sibling may also work.  A later release will iron out any edge cases)

### Convert object to Json

In order to convert the object to Json specify the `generateJson`. 

    @Morphy(generateJson: true)
    abstract class $Pet {

Add the dev dependency to the json_serializable package
    
    dart pub add json_serializable --dev

Add the part file, .g is required by the json_serializable package used internally by `morphy`

    part 'Pets.g.dart';
    part 'Pets.morphy.dart';

Build the generated files then use the toJson_2 method to generate the JSON

    var json = flossy.toJson_2({});
    expect(json, {'name': 'Flossy', 'age': 5, '_className_': 'Pet'});

### Convert Json to Object

Use the factory method `Pet.fromJson()` to create the new object.

    var json = {'name': 'Flossy', 'age': 5, '_className_': 'Pet'};

    var flossyFromJson = Pet.fromJson(json);
    var flossy = Pet(name: "Flossy", age: 5);

    expect(flossyFromJson == flossy, true);

### Json to Object Polymorphism

Unlike other json conversions you can convert subtypes using the super types toJson and fromJson functions.
   
The subtypes must be specified in the explicitSubTypes and in the correct order for this to work.

    @Morphy(generateJson: true, explicitSubTypes: [$Z, $Y])
    abstract class $X {
      String get val;
    }
    
    @Morphy(generateJson: true, explicitSubTypes: [$Z])
    abstract class $Y implements $X {
      int get valY;
    }
    
    @Morphy(generateJson: true)
    abstract class $Z implements $Y {
      double get valZ;
    }

    var xObjects = [
      X(val: "x"),
      Y(val: "xy", valY: 1),
      Z(val: "xyz", valY: 2, valZ: 4.34),
    ];

We can then just convert our list of X objects to JSON preserving their original type.

    var resultInJsonFormat = xObjects.map((e) => e.toJson_2({})).toList();

    var expectedJson = [
      {'val': 'x', '_className_': 'X'},
      {'val': 'xy', 'valY': 1, '_className_': 'Y'},
      {'val': 'xyz', 'valY': 2, 'valZ': 4.34, '_className_': 'Z'}
    ];

    expect(resultInJsonFormat, expectedJson);

and then convert them back again, continuing to preserve their original type

    var resultXObjects = expectedJson.map((e) => X.fromJson(e)).toList();

    expect(resultXObjects, xObjects);

Also generics work and more complicated inheritance hierarchies. (see the tests ex52 in the example folder)

### Multiple Inheritance

We also allow multiple inheritance.

    @Morphy(generateJson: true)
    abstract class $FrankensteinsDogCat implements $Dog, $Cat {}

    var frankie = FrankensteinsDogCat(whiskerLength: 13.75, woofSound: "rowf", name: "frankie", age: 1);

    expect(frankie is Cat, true);
    expect(frankie is Dog, true);

### Custom Constructors

To allow custom constructors you can simply create a publicly accessible factory function that calls the constructor (ie just a method that calls the default constructor). 
If you'd like to hide the automatic constructor set the `hidePublicConstructor` on the Morphy annotation to true.
If you do hide the default constructor, 
then in order for the custom factory function (A_FactoryFunction in the example below) to be able to call the hidden (or private) default constructor, 
your factory function should live in the same file you defined your class.

    @Morphy(hidePublicConstructor: true)
    abstract class $A {
      String get val;
      DateTime get timestamp;
    }

    A A_FactoryFunction(String val) {
      return A._(val: val, timestamp: DateTime(2023, 11, 25));
    }

    var a = A_FactoryFunction("my value");

    expect(a.timestamp, DateTime(2023, 11, 25));

### Optional Parameters

Optional parameters can be specified using the ? keyword on the getter property.

    @morphy
    abstract class $B {
      String get val;
      String? get optional;
    }

    var b = B(val: "5");

    expect(b.optional, null);

### Comments

Comments are copied from the class definition to the generated class
and for ease of use copied to the constructor too. 

### Constant Constructor

Just define a blank const constructor in your class definition file

    const $A();


### Other

Self referencing classes are allowed.

Overriding properties with a sub type in a subclass is allowed.

If you need to navigate back to the class definition (not the generated code) it is
a kind of two step route back.  You must go to the generated and then you can click on the
$ version of the class which will be next to it.

Sometimes one class needs to be built before another.
In that scenario use morphy2 as the annotation in one class and morphy in the other.
